client config

- used a t2.micro ec2 (vagrant for testing provisioning...)
- provision according to artillery_play.yml in hx-provision


notes

- tried to issue users from vagrant instance but it hits some limit maybe
  because it is a vm? nodejs dns errors:
    . "getaddrinfo EAI_AGAIN naomi.hxat.hxtech.org:443"
